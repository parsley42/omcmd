NOTE: I no longer run my own dhcp server, so can only give minimal time
to this project. I'll gladly read and accept reasonable patches with
explanations.

omcmd is a scriptable CLI program for performing actions on a running ISC dhcp
server using OMAPI.  It can currently be used to create, remove, modify and 
look up hosts and leases.

Note that these objects are 'stored' in the dhcpd.leases file.

Building:
You must install dhcp-devel first.  Check the locations of the include files
for dhcp.  I don't know squat about autoconf & friends, just type 'make' and
correct any errors you get. ;-)

Usage: omcmd [-k keyname secret | -K keyfile ] [-s server] [-v] \
  <command> <objtype> <args>

The keyname & secret are the same as the values in the dhcpd.conf file;
the secret is base64 encoded.  If using a 'keyfile', line1=keyname, 
line2=secret.

-v for verbose output (see below)

command is one of:
    lookup - find an object and print  properties
    create - create a new object
    remove - remove an object
    modify - modify an object

objtype is one of:
    host
    lease

For all commands, the first arg should be of the form property=value, and
should be a 'lookup' value (see OMAPI in man dhcpd), i.e.: 
ip-address=10.20.30.40.  For remove, this is the only required argument.

For create & modify, the remaining arguments are more property=value strings
supported properties so far:
    ip-address - e.g. "ip-address=10.20.30.40"
    hardware-type - e.g. "hardware-type=1" (you almost always use this when 
	specifying the hardware-address)
    hardware-address - e.g. "hardware-address=00:10:20:30:40:50"
    state - e.g. "state=free" (you can use this to free an active lease**)
    name - e.g. "name=mylaptop"
    client-hostname (similar)
For the appropriate properties for an object type, see 'man dhcp'.

** dhcp-3.0.1 won't allow leases to be freed dynamically as-is.  I've included
a (short) dhcp-omapifree.patch, that, when applied, will actually free leases
if state is set to 'free'.

For 'lookup', you can leave off remaining args, and it will print what it
finds (in verbose mode).  You can also specify property names you want found,
and it will spit them out one per line (non-verbose mode), or as
property=value strings (verbose). Lookup properties supported are: ends, tstp,
tsfp, cltt, ip-address, client-hostname, name, dhcp-client-identifier,
hardware-address, hardware-type, and state.

Currenlty, only host & lease objects are supported, but adding support for
other known object types shouldn't be hard.

The return value is 255 for invalid usage, otherwise a value of type
isc_result_t.
(see include/isc-dhcp/result.h)

Examples:

Lookup a lease and print everything:

$ ./omcmd -K ~/keyfile -s myserver lookup lease ip-address=10.20.93.155
state=active
ip-address=10.20.93.155
dhcp-client-identifier=01:00:e0:b8:72:8f:90
client-hostname=AU1201
hardware-address=00:e0:b8:72:8f:90
hardware-type=1
ends=Sat Jul 31 15:54:28 2004
tstp=Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969
tsfp=Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969
cltt=Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969

Lookup a lease and just give the hardware-address:

$ ./omcmd -K ~/keyfile -s myserver lookup lease ip-address=10.20.93.155 hardware-address
00:e0:b8:72:8f:90

Change a lease state to free:

$ ./omcmd -K ~/keyfile -s myserver modify lease ip-address=10.20.162.42 state=free

Note: I wasn't able to 'remove' a lease; the best I could figure was to 'free'
it.
Note2: the first prop=value is used to look up the object, all following will
update the object.

Create a new host:

$ ./omcmd -K ~/keyfile -s myserver create host ip-address=10.20.162.242 name=ioreth hardware-type=1 hardware-address=00:e0:b8:50:0f:ab

Note: ip-address is optional.

Delete that host:

$ ./omcmd -K ~/keyfile -s myserver remove host name=ioreth
